I'm a undergraduate student from [School of Physics](https://physics.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). My research interest focuses on the deep learning, artificial intelligence and their combinding with medical or else.

In the past year, I studied and researched together with Prof. Quan and Dr. Pang on how to use deep learning to improve the image quality of medical imaging. As co-first authors, our paper ["Comparison and evaluation of different deep learning models of synthetic CT generation from CBCT for nasopharynx cancer adaptive proton therapy"](https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.16777) was published in Medical Physics.
